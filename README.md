## **ðŸŒŸ Core Features (Version 1 - MVP)**

### **ðŸ”¹ How It Works**

1. **Frontend**:
    
    - A **simple HTML form** where users enter a webpage URL for scraping.
    - Flask-powered backend to process user requests.
    - (Future: CLI module if demand is high)
2. **Backend:**
    
    - **Flask Web Server**: Manages scraping, downloads, and responses.
    - **Web Scraper** (BeautifulSoup + Requests): Extracts MP3 links from the provided URL.
    - **Automated Batch Downloads**:
        - All detected MP3 files are added to a queue.
        - Files are downloaded sequentially without user confirmation.
        - Stored in a **designated local folder**.
3. **Basic Logging & Error Handling**:
    
    - Handles **broken links, timeouts, and missing MP3s** gracefully.
    - Logs failed downloads for debugging.

âœ… **Outcome**: A functional web scraper with **batch MP3 downloads and a minimal UI**.

## **ðŸš€ Version 2: Enhanced Features**

### **ðŸ”¹ User-Controlled Download Options**

- **Selectable Downloads**:
    
    - After scraping, users see a **list of MP3 files** with checkboxes.
